    <h3>Import products using the GDAL library</h3>

    <p>This command allows to open the data of different products in SNAP.
	   If there is no suitable reader to open a certain product, then the GDAL reader tries to open the product.
	   If there is at least a suitable reader to open a certain product except the GDAL reader, then a dialog window 
	   is displayed to choose the reader used to open the product. If the GDAL reader cannot open the product then a message dialog is displayed.
	</p>
	<p>	   
	   Most known raster formats supported are: GeoTIFF, Erdas Imagine, ECW, MrSID, JPEG2000, DTED, NITF, GeoPackage.
    </p>
	<p>	   
	   The GDAL library version used is 2.1.0. If this library is already installed, then it is used; otherwise the application will install it.
	   This functionality is available on machines with the Microsoft Windows operating system.
